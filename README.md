# Class Based Inheritance
Class based inheritance let's you specify that one type will contain all of the properties and methods that are defined in another type, without having to duplicate the code in the two source code files. Inheritance is a powerful feature of C#, but it should be used sparingly when you are defining many types in your program.

# Why Are You Learning This?
You will use inheritance to reduce the amount of duplicated code that can arise in a system with dozens of types that all share the exact same properties and/or methods. It's one of the mechanisms to introduce polymorphism into a program.

You will likely be asked about inheritance during the interview process and should be able to describe it in one of the following ways.

Allows one type to include all of the public properties and methods of another type.
It reduces duplicated code when many types in a program all have the same properties and methods.
